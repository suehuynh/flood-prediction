# Regression with a Flood Prediction Dataset
**Kaggle Playground May 2024**

About the Tabular Playground Series
The goal of the Tabular Playground Series is to provide the Kaggle community with a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge. The challenges will generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.

As a beginner in data science, I have done a lot of trial-and-errors through Hyperparameter Tuning and first-time trying Ensembling/Stacking method! My R2 score has jumped from 0.83 to 0.845
